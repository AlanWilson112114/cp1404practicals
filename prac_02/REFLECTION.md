70%

 I make an effort to improve my understanding and develop my skills, and I plan to keep this up.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop underestimating the time required to complete tasks and avoid assuming that everything I write is automatically correct. I’ll focus more on reviewing and double-checking my work.
## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I’ve been getting distracted and not staying focused on the task. I need to improve my concentration and stick to the goals of each practical session.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I actively review the lecture videos and notes alongside the practicals, which helps me reinforce key concepts. This, combined with hands-on coding and problem-solving, is helping me steadily improve my skills and understanding.
